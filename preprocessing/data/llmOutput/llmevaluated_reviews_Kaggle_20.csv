It reads like a frustrated rant from a user who likely hasn't fully experienced the location and is expressing a general dissatisfaction. The subjectivity score (0.38) supports this interpretation."
Tuana Restaurant,Ahmet Ekim,DEFINITELY DO NOT COME. We came here for breakfast based on the reviews on the way. We said the breakfast called the village breakfast for 2 people. First of all; the employee greeted us disrespectfully; a thousand pieces falling off his face; reluctant movements etc. It didn't taste good either!,1,0.38,0.48,en,50,1,4,False,Neutral,0,0,1,1,"The review expresses extreme negativity and detailed, subjective observations (disrespectful greeting, appearance of the employee, poor taste) suggesting a highly emotional and potentially unverified rant rather than a constructive review. The use of phrases like “DEFINITELY DO NOT COME” and the excessive detail point to a personal frustration and a lack of objective assessment.

While the sentiment is positive (0.61), the language leans heavily toward hyperbole, suggesting it's more of an enthusiastic personal experience rather than a helpful review for potential customers. There's no mention of the atmosphere, service, or anything related to the business itself, making it a potentially unreliable review."
