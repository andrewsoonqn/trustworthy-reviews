The Lo Mein was too soft. On the other hand, our server, Gayle, was lovely. The waiters constantly refilled our waters and they asked us how our food was for each dish they brought out. Everything tasted good. The family-style dinner with a big rotating plate in the middle is fun.

Found this hidden gem today. Me and my wife were looking for a good breakfast spot, our usual places to eat were not available due to hours of operation changing frequently. Fortunately for us, we heard about a new restaurant open in Bellow falls and they serve breakfast so we had to check this place out.

This restaurant is roadside so when you are within 1-2 miles, drive a little slower for your first time so you don't pass their entrance.

They have adequate parking available ( free parking)

As soon as you pull up, you notice the outside view and all the decorations, they have perennials, mums, succulents, a large variety of plants all decorated on the porches and sides of the building.

As you enter the restaurant ( if it's your first time) grab a menu and take a few minutes to see what they have. You go to the counter up front, place your order, grab your drinks, and find a table.

You pay before the meal, they accept cash /credit, also be sure to include the tip in your purchase ( unless you want to tip at the end of the meal)

They bring your food to your table for you, while you are waiting for your meal don't forget to get your coffee ( if you ordered one )

The wait was short and our food came out picture perfect!

Everything we ordered came out accurate and the taste was üëåüëå perfect.

The coffee was perfect, my cappuccino was perfect, they even put the froth on top.

As you finish your meal before you go there is one last task to complete, here you bring your dishes and cups back towards the front and go to the short hall next to the stairs. They have trash cans and a bus pan for you to put all your food waste and plastic, etc.

Once you cleared all the plates you put the dishes into the bus pan and that's it üòÅ

Before you go don't forget to check out there mini Mart / produce selection.

Towards the opposite end of their restaurant is a mini Mart where you can purchase locally grown produce, locally made syrup, hand made candles, home made hot sauce,  locally made wines , they have bottled beverages, pastries, and so much more!

You also are able to purchase some of there locally grown plants found outside, and this time of year they have their own pumpkin patch and pumpkins available for purchase üòÅ

If you are in the area or just passing through definitely stop here ...you will not regret it! üëçüëç

When you first come into the entryway something magical happens.. first the scent of exotic yet familiar smells entangle your nose, the faint melody of a familiar yet unrecognizable song tickles your ear... When you open the next door the menagerie of wonderous local art dances in front of your eyes as the sounds and smells increase to totally dazzle your senses. As you turn the corner and face the bar, you're greeted with a smile filled with all the care in the world.. boom. You have become family and you are welcomed and celebrated as such.
It doesn't matter if you're alone, it doesn't matter if your friends are with you, it doesn't matter if you're on a first date with some internet stranger you've never met and hope doesn't murder you when you turn your back. All the unease of your day, all of the anxiety of your life melts away. By the time you take your coat off and can even form words you feel like you have walked into some familiar relatives living room.

You're home.

This is not some sandwich shop where you just show up expecting to hide in a corner and glue your eyes to your phone oblivious to the beautiful art and cozy decor surrounding you.
Go to subway for that dispasionate sterile experience.
You will feel empowered to take part in the rolling conversations, you will be feel free to talk about how your life is without judgement, offered familial advise, and most importantly you will be wholly loved from the second you take a step in the door by everyone there.

Latszo is not simply a delicatessen curator, he is an artist who pours his heart into his craft. The food he prepares, the extravagantly exquisite tastes he imagines, the soul he puts into each dish can only be matched by someone who loves their guests as much as he does. A rare thing most especially these days.

The food served contains flavors not found anywhere else.

I cannot possibly recommend Four Corners enough. 5 stars is inadequate.",5,"Four Corners is where you go when you want a meal that hugs you from the inside.

Breakfast was hardly basic, we ended up going to the DD across the parking lot. The people in the room next to us were smoking pot. (Yes, I get that it's legal in VT ) But we didn't appreciate that it was wafting into our room as well. The front desk was notified about this. Overall- super disappointed, would not recommend. The only good thing about this hotel was the location .",0.08,0.5,en,153,0,2,False,False

I personally always want the mechanics that run and operate the business.  They still have good services.  Its more a combination of newer State laws for inspection to several other mechanics.  The new mechanics, I personally do not know them, nor anything other than because they're newer mechanics trained, taught and licensed without any or barely any practical skills vs books and exams passed.  Meaning the knowledge is there, but the on hands training not so much anymore.  Not because of R&D but because of State standards,  allowing people to be certified without much on hands experience that is critical for proper repairs and results of such repairs. This is a problem across the board for all repair shops in VT, possibly across all 50 States. R&D did not create this in experience problem,  they like all Automotive repair shops have to deal with the consequences of the new laws passed by legislation even though the Public never voted for such extreme measures to simply pass an inspection,  where C.A sets the standards it seems for all other States, not even putting it to a public vote.
They pass these partisan measures that really have ZERO effects in VT in comparison to C.A. politicians created the problem.
We all know that manufacturers & States are pushing an agenda to force everyone into NEW vehicles.  When a vehicle is 100% safe, and the only reason it will not pass an inspection is because of a Secondary (not primary) mass air flow injector.  A very expensive and rather small part of the charcoal system in between the gas tank and fuel lines. The stupidity of the charcoal system simply adds more parts to go bad costing more.  There was NO reason to add a charcoal system,  the old standard gas lines were enough.  If you had a gas leak or could smell fumes it was far easier to replace or repair than this system added.
I personally will not waste $400+ on a part and possible 2+ labor hours that guess what...
After a vehicle is 15 years or older, it no longer matters according to VT law and will pass with this particular error code. In fact your allowed up to 2 code errors and still pass so long as the car is physically safe and no gas or exhaust leaks are detectable.  No drips, no smoke, no loud noises yet it will not pass?
15 years is 15 years.  That is really my only issue. A 2005 car as of January 2020 is now a FULL 15 years old starting into the 16th.  Why can other places tell you yes the year is now good to go as of Jan 1st and the place I've used for several years for inspections tell me it's not until 2021, Wish someone could explain the difference in Math vs the others?
If all the other shopsi spoke with say yes as of January 1st it meets the requirements to pass . Yes of course all physical parts,  tires, mufflers,  wheel bearings etc must be in good shape
from a business perspective that is loosing out many potential customers who are simply going to use a shop that is allowing 2005s. For some reason R&D are behind one year compared to 3 other places I spoke to and the State as well.   I simply cannot fathom loosing business over such an issue.  It makes mo sense to loose paying customers.i would want to know why others can yet ""my shop"" can't? Personally in past experiences dealing Solely with Dan or Rich things were always  good.  The last couple of years, have caused much changes.  I truly hope they are able to find a balance that brings them back to where they were 4 to 5 years ago. I rather miss having Dan or Rich doing the work compared to far less knowledgeable ones.  People want to pay for the the names they see on the sign. If I did this review 4- 5 years ago I would be saying what great work Rich and Dan do and back then it was at a rate locals could better afford.

I had formally talked with a sales professional who was very nice, very outgoing, and seemingly understanding to my, particular situation.  However, two specific things that have completely turned me off to their services, 1) I told them that, until I decided on whether I would buy the car, I did not want a hard credit check done, and the salesman said they wouldn‚Äôt do that until I gave the go ahead.  No sooner had 24 hours past and I got a notification saying Twin State Ford had performed a hard credit check on me and my credit score would be going down.  Not cool Twin State!  My other issue with this dealership, 2) is that when talking about price, I was told that I‚Äôd be paying just over $13,000 for the used car I was interested in.  When I got home and did the math, that price did not include the interest rate, and I would be paying well over $16,000 for the car overall.  I do not appreciate being lied to, or there to be hidden fees within the negotiated price.

0x4cca1ac0f9892617:0xdcf571280ae9fa88,Quinn Reid,"When I was buying a newer Prius, I started by contacting two Toyota dealers (Handy was not one of them!), one near my home and the other near my workplace. I went to visit both of them, talked to their salespeople in person, and tried to get the kind of deal my Internet research told me was reasonable. At both of these other dealers, the salespeople did a poor job of responding to my questions, didn't offer me anything like the deal I wanted, and tried to pressure me with obnoxious tactics like trying to get me to buy before the end of the month because the manager was trying to win a family trip he could go on with his son, who had severe health problems. Seriously? I have no idea if that particular story was true or not, but even if it was, it was extremely inappropriate as a means to pressure me into buying before I was ready.

My experience at Handy was completely different. They were nowhere near my home, so I did all my initial communication through phone and e-mail with Tom Young. He was able to offer me a very good deal on both the vehicle I was buying and my trade-in, though of course the trade-in amount was contingent on them actually seeing the vehicle. When they did see it, they were satisfied that I had described it accurately and that it had no problems I hadn't mentioned, so they gave me the exact amount they had estimated. The deal Tom was able to offer me without haggling was exactly the deal I was looking for, and I took it--which is great, because I don't like haggling. If I don't feel like I'm getting a good deal, instead of haggling, I just go somewhere where I'll be treated better. Handy's Toyota turns out to be that place.

After we agreed on the car price and the trade-in, I wasn't fully prepared to decide on the add-ons I was offered while doing the paperwork, like gap insurance, and I didn't feel especially comfortable with how that part of the process went, but I was not pressured and to the best of my knowledge, everything they were offering me was pretty much what you'd be offered when buying any new car anywhere. Further, when I opted into something and later realized I wouldn't need it, Reg provided me with a simple form to cancel it.

I don't feel as though purchasing a car is something a person can ever do with complete trust for the dealer: after all, while the buyer's interests overlap with the dealer's for a ways, at a certain point we're both just trying to get the sweetest deal we can. Tom at Handy, however, clearly prioritized our shared interest, coming to a mutually agreeable deal. The next time anyone I know is interested in buying a Toyota or a Chevy, I'll be strongly urging them to go to Handy (and specifically to Tom, if they're looking for a Toyota).",5,"When I was buying a newer Prius, I started by contacting two Toyota dealers (Handy was not one of them!), one near my home and the other near my workplace.

I ordered the escargot special, it was ok bordering on not ok, but I guess it's not normally offered so that's on me. I ordered the steak frites and it was good but they cook a little bit under what you ask for as another in our party got the same thing and hers was a bit under cooked too. Two others in our group got a seared tuna dish and they really enjoyed it.

We've since been back and I ordered the clam chowder which was tasty but had some sand in it from the clams. Not a lot, but enough to get my attention. Growing up in New England you kind of expect that sometimes, but it still isn't that pleasant.

We like it and will go back for sure, just need to make sure a band isn't there since the brick walls just bounce the sound around with no absorption.

I talked with someone before hand on the phone to make sure they had the machine to spool it, they said they do so I headed out. Once I get in I talk to a guy about what I need and I explicitly say I need 10lb mono backing (open face reels are all brass and braid will slip causing back lashes) for a trip to catch musky in New York. He agrees to back it and heads back to spool it. Once he gets out I ask him how much backing he used and he says it didn't need much and in total I have 130 yards. Sounds great. That night I head out to the place in New York we will be fishing and get set up for what should have been a great day.

First cast, I get a terrible backlash. I check the drag and mechanical breaking and they are both set correctly. I had not let it hit the water it bird's nested while still in the air. It was so bad I couldnt get the back lash out and ended up having to cut roughly 25 dollars of line I'd never used off. I get the the bottom and low and behold HE DIDNT USE ANY BACKING!! This not only screwed my entire weekend up that being my only set up for fishing musky but was extremely rude to lie right to my face saying he had done a mono backing when he hadn't actually. I get it if you don't know how to, but why say you will, and then lie saying you did when asked? It's beyond me I don't understand if he just couldn't be bothered but in any case it really messed my weekend up and lost me some money in the process. I'll never be going back. It's to bad because it is one of the only sporting goods stores in my area.

Edit: I talked with the guys at R and L this morning and explained what had happened, they were very understanding and did everything they could to make it right including reimbursing me for the line lost.

Food was delicious - we started with the crispy chicken wings, dry rub. I wasn't sure if I would like them but wow. Super yum.

The Grouse Breakfast Sandwich was full of savory flavor, though I could see it being to heavy for some. The side salad lightly dressed helped cut through some of the heaviness. My husband got the Pastrami Smoked Salmon which he thought was good. We're from NYC so the bagel wasn't our favorite but good enough. Served with capers so that's a good touch.

There are many types of cheese, with baskets filled with Cabot ends for greatly reduced prices- my favourite? The 5 year old Cabot cheddar- I grate and put on chips for amazing nachos- nothing else needed, the flavour is so good.
There is a cooler, where you can buy yoghurts and milk- and other dairy products. Also, a great natural health and beauty section with huge discounts. I have bought ""rescue remedy"" for $6.99 !!
There is a Vermont area for tourists to sample local wares.
Downstairs, is an entire level of wines, meads, hard ciders and specialty brews and beers. It can be a bit overwhelming, as it takes a while to walk through- but, there is always something lovely to find and take home.
The clerks are lovely and helpful, and even carry your purchases to your car, if needed.

Sometime mescaline greens with free range or grass feed whatever isn‚Äôt going to cut it.  Sometimes only a hearty deli sandwich will do.  Today was one of those days.
So it came down to visiting one of my favorite breakfast spots for lunch and the Pearl Street Diner won out.  Always famous for their breakfasts, now was a chance to further taste their other menu delights.
A Rueben sandwich with chips and pickle stood out as the way to go today.  My waitperson a pleasant young woman took my order and drew me a large, frosty root beer from the soda dispenser.
After a few quaffs of the sweet beverage my Rueben was in the kitchen window waiting to be picked up and delivered.
It was at a moment like this having a camera to take a picture of the steaming hot sandwich split open with a mound of ripple cut potato chips between the halves of the sandwich with two pickle spears off to the side would have been handy.
Well the waitperson delivered my Rueben with a smile as she said this was the last one for the day and to enjoy it.  Boy did I ever.  First the sandwich was piping hot, even after coming off the flat top and being plated for a couple of minutes.
Then after the first bite you knew why.  It was the dense non-commercial pumpernickel bread that held the heat.  With less air and more substance the homemade bread stayed hot on the plate for a good 8-10 minutes.
Then it was the in house made corned beef.  Three nice thick slices of it made up the interior of the sandwich.  Complemented by well drained sauerkraut and tangy Thousand Island dressing it was the perfect marriage of all of the ingredients.  Not too much, not too little, just right as the story goes.
The sandwich was impossible to eat quickly as it stayed hot throughout the entire meal and every bite of the grilled perfectly proportioned sandwich was to be savored between swigs of icy cold root beer.
With beverage the bill was $11.00 plus $2.00 for the waitperson‚Äôs gratuity.   This wasn‚Äôt a happy meal price point but one thing to be learned from eating high quality food is this.  It sticks with you.  It was a late lunch for me and it kept me satisfied for the rest of the day.
The Pearl Street Diner is located at 85 Pearl Street and is open Tuesday through Sunday for breakfast and lunch.  Give them a try; you‚Äôll be glad you did.

Breakfast 10/20/2013
It had been sometime since a breakfast at the Pearl Street Diner had been had, so today was the big comeback day.  It was an overcast, windy Halloween morning and something hot and delicious was in order.

Entering the restaurant I thought nothing of the waitress who had fairy wings and tights on.  She is an attractive blend of Kate Upton and Nicole Kidman and anything would look good on her.

When the chef came out from behind the grill area he was a mess.  Blood and guts were all over his apron and he had the zombie look about him.

Even owner Pam was in on the fun as she said the breakfast specials were boo-berry pancakes and spook-tac-lar egg specials.

Arriving just before the 9 AM breakfast special cutoff my fairy good looking waitress cut me some slack and gave me the deal of the day.  Two eggs, over medium, toast, bacon and breakfast potatoes for $4.99.

As my breakfast was prepared I noticed that several of the morning customers were also attired in costume.  There was a lot of good natured banter flying about between the staff and diners about the costumes everyone was wearing.

The breakfast was perfectly cooked, the staff and owner were good natured in their observance of Halloween and I couldn‚Äôt have had a more fun and delicious breakfast.

This is why local places are the best and their personalization will always beat fast food and national chains everyday of the week.",5,"Lunch 6/10/2014 Sometime mescaline greens with free range or grass feed whatever isn‚Äôt going to cut it.

0x4cca7af78ed6ac55:0x304ba4978f4662d3,Scott Remick,"So we went to Gaku Ramen recently for the first time. We were excited at the prospect of an authentic ramen source within an hour of us, as we have been limited to only being able to get it at a number of locations in Montreal (which we visit at least once a month). My partner also spent a significant amount of time in Japan and so has considerable first-hand experience with authentic ramen.

While things seemed promising and our experience was still basically positive, things fell short of hopes and expectations and unfortunately I'm not sure we'll be returning unless some things are addressed.

The first disappointment was the menu. Nowhere on the menu was an turnkey option for actual, traditional ramen (pork chashu, scallions, nori, 1/2 egg). This immediately caused us concern. However, talking with our waiter (who was very nice), we determined we could modify in a way that wouldn't affect price. Still, any place advertising ""authentic"" ramen should at the bare minimum actually HAVE a traditional ramen bowl on the menu to select. If they want to offer their own creative variations and twists, that is fine and can be enjoyable... but have the basics, please. The waiter said that many people were just tossing the nori, but I don't see that as a legitimate excuse. If someone doesn't want nori, they can order one of the other ramen bowls like the menu already has, or request them to keep it off.

Second disappointment was the prices. It immediately became obvious that this place was a bit over-priced. Perhaps due to being the only game in town without competition, but still. $1.75 for the additional toppings is quite high, when normally even fancy places might only charge $0.75/ea.

I ordered the traditional Tonkotsu ramen. We found the broth to actually be quite light and not quite accurate, especially for the broth that is supposed to be the richer and more-savory option. The noodles (they only have 3 noodle options, for this one they put in what they just call the ""thin noodles"" were ok but not quite right. The prok chashu was very strange, being very thin slices like deli cuts than normal pork chunks like one would expect. Granted it wasn't as fatty, but I wasn't a fan.

I also ordered a glass of sake. I got a good amount, but strangely served in a champagne flute, which felt very odd and out of place.

My partner ordered the black garlic miso, with nori and egg. I actually liked her broth more than mine, finding it far more flavorful and rich. The noodles (these were the ""curly noodles"") were a huge disappointment, being extremely doughy and chewy. They were almost unpalatable. She was also very disappointed to only get one slice of nori, especially when you're being over-charged $1.75.

We considered the karaage but didn't order it. Partially because it was too overpriced ($8!!!), but also you're only getting 4-5 oz (5-6 pieces) for that price. A shame as that is one of our favorite things to almost always order with our ramen. There was also edamame (one of my favorites) as well as gyoza which we also sometimes order, but we passed here as the cost was going up but the experience going down.

Not all was bad. I definitely appreciated the location, and we felt that the decor was very sharp and nice. This is a place with a lot of potential on the surface, but really needs to work on prices and menu if they really intend to nail the ""authentic ramen"" thing. Right now their promises fall quite short, and you pay dearly for it.

I look forward to them hopefully continuing to hear this feedback from enough other people and take it to heart, addressing their menu and prices. At that time we'll gladly return to give it another chance.",2,"So we went to Gaku Ramen recently for the first time.

It's a very quaint farm stand with the sweetest yellow lab that loves to greet everyone who enters. If you are in the area you need to check this place out. Fresh made pies and apple cider donuts.  We couldn't decide on one pie so we bought a pecan pie and a blueberry crumble. We had the blueberry crumble for dessert tonight. It was very good but so very different  from any other blueberry pie I have ever eaten. Who can resist fresh apple cider donuts? DEFINITELY NOT US!

It's a very quaint farm stand with the sweetest yellow lab that loves to greet everyone who enters. If you are in the area you need to check this place out. Fresh made pies and apple cider donuts. We couldn't decide on one pie so we bought a pecan pie and a blueberry crumble. We had the blueberry crumble for dessert tonight. It was very good but so very different from any other blueberry pie I have ever eaten. Who can resist fresh apple cider donuts? DEFINITELY NOT US!

------------------------------------

""Where Service is King"" couldn't be further from the truth with this dealership.

I bought my car from Freedom Nissan on July 31st. To their credit - I love my car! It was a decent price, but the sales process was... average at best. Pushy tactics, purposefully slow ""let me check with my manager"" interactions designed to wear me out. Oh well.

One of the more unusual portions of my experience was that when we went to test drive the vehicle I was interested in (and ended up purchasing), one of the tires was nearly flat! My sales person filled the tire up and we were off. It was mentioned that ""I'll make sure our people will take care of that slow leak for you"".

The morning after I bought the car, I had to run to a gas station to fill the tire with air. ""No big deal"" I thought - I knew I had to bring my trade-in's title into the dealership, so I'd bug someone about it then. When I brought my title in, I mentioned the issue to the gentleman I gave it to. He advised that I text the sales person I worked with - so I did! He responded quickly:

""I will talk to our service department and get back to you!""

48 hours passed and I heard nothing!

At this point I am filling up my tire with air every morning and afternoon. I texted the sales person a picture of my almost completely deflated tire and told him that it was getting worse, and asked if there was any progress...

another 48 hours and again, no response.

Finally, he responded: ""I'm going to talk to the service manager, I'll have him give you a shout!""

It has now been almost four full days since then, and I have heard nothing  from Freedom Nissan except the texts represented in this review since buying my car.

What's funny is that I talked to both my sales person (Jake) and another employee at Freedom Nissan about people leaving 1-Star Reviews on Google. From both people I heard ""Oh, yeah, those people just want free stuff. It's obnoxious.""

Well, here's the truth: Folks are leaving 1-Star reviews on this listing because this dealership is unresponsive and obviously far beyond their capacity in the customer service department.

I will not be returning here, as they stopped caring about me and my safety even before they pocketed my money.

I bought my car from Freedom Nissan on July 31st. To their credit - I love my car! It was a decent price, but the sales process was... average at best. Pushy tactics, purposefully slow ""let me check with my manager"" interactions designed to wear me out. Oh well. One of the more unusual portions of my experience was that when we went to test drive the vehicle I was interested in (and ended up purchasing), one of the tires was nearly flat! My sales person filled the tire up and we were off. It was mentioned that ""I'll make sure our people will take care of that slow leak for you"". The morning after I bought the car, I had to run to a gas station to fill the tire with air. ""No big deal"" I thought - I knew I had to bring my trade-in's title into the dealership, so I'd bug someone about it then. When I brought my title in, I mentioned the issue to the gentleman I gave it to. He advised that I text the sales person I worked with - so I did! He responded quickly: ""I will talk to our service department and get back to you!"" 48 hours passed and I heard nothing! At this point I am filling up my tire with air every morning and afternoon. I texted the sales person a picture of my almost completely deflated tire and told him that it was getting worse, and asked if there was any progress... another 48 hours and again, no response. Finally, he responded: ""I'm going to talk to the service manager, I'll have him give you a shout!"" It has now been almost four full days since then, and I have heard nothing from Freedom Nissan except the texts represented in this review since buying my car. What's funny is that I talked to both my sales person (Jake) and another employee at Freedom Nissan about people leaving 1-Star Reviews on Google. From both people I heard ""Oh, yeah, those people just want free stuff. It's obnoxious."" Well, here's the truth: Folks are leaving 1-Star reviews on this listing because this dealership is unresponsive and obviously far beyond their capacity in the customer service department. I will not be returning here, as they stopped caring about me and my safety even before they pocketed my money.

Madison's offer casual, family friendly dining with an outdoor space and inside bar in addition to two large dining areas. There is seating at high tops in the bar, too, just order and pick up your food. Specials are offered daily and provided on a sheet separate from the menu.

The food is consistently good although the pasta is often too much (this is a trend in Bennington) and gets old fast.

The beer is okay. It's the only brew pub in town (plus!) but if you are a beer snob like we are it is solidly ""okay"". Every once in a while something comes out that stands out. Other than that, it's nothing to write home about.

My gripe with Madison's is flaky service. More than once I have had them forget something. Not a huge deal but an amateur mistake. I have a significant food allergy so it's best to check your order if you need something omitted. I once asked for no Caesar dressing (explaining that it was allergy related) and they put it on anyway. When it came back after being sent back they had put the dressing in a to go cup that had spilled onto the plate. I rarely ask for omissions/substitutions and when I do I specify that it's an allergy. I wish they'd be more careful.

I planned to hike Mt. Mansfield with my friends during my fall foliage trip to Vermont. We took the auto toll road up to the visitors center which was $25 per vehicle with a driver and $9 for additional passengers. If you‚Äôre planning to hike from the very bottom of the mountain, there are a couple of trails to watch out for.

The visitors center was closed during our time of visit due to COVID but there was a helpful guide who was giving us information about the hike and guiding other travelers and hikers. There were a couple of hikes from that point.

Let‚Äôs talk about the hike itself. The hike was not ordinary. It had steep edges, rocks, 500feet elevation at once, rain pouring from the sky, winds and wet patches of ground. The weather is constantly changing at the top. We were fortunate enough to get a good weather during our hike but as soon as we reached the summit, the weather changed and it was all cloudy and a little rain poured while going downhill.  The hike was around around 1hr 45 - 2 hr while going up even though we took a lot of stops in between to click pictures and just admire the beauty. I‚Äôd highly recommend getting a proper set of hiking boots to conquer this summit.

The hike is absolutely beautiful albeit tough but, the views are spectacular and worth a try.",5,"Mt. Mansfield is not your typical everyday hike. This isn‚Äôt for the faint of hearts.

If you have any computer repair competency avoid these folks.  They're more interested in making you pay for repairs than selling you parts, so they can get that $90 minimum service fee.

They will refuse to accept returns even with receipts present, even if you used a product once because of a ""store policy"" they come up with on the spot.  Let me reiterate: your receipt means nothing here.

They'll low-ball you on absolutely everything.  Most of the laptops they get are donations because people think they're making a difference, but in reality they just cannibalize the parts for their overpriced repairs while fooling everyone into thinking they're some kind of charity.  I'm sure they donate at least a handful of dinosaur laptops a year to get a tax break on that pricy downtown storefront.

Many of the accessories are used or off-brand garbage they then try to sell for premium prices.  You can find better on eBay or Amazon for 1/4th the price.

Don't even try to understand

And take it easy

Such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord
In a flat-bed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby

If your sweet love
Is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win
Though we will never be here again
So open up, I'm climbin' in

Got a world of trouble on my mind

This is a huge store but the aisles are way too narrow for the number of customers in the store with big shopping carts.  The aisle passageways are made even tinier and harder to negotiate for anyone with the slightest walking handicaps with ridiculously, oversized point of sale displays that hang up on shopping cart edges as you try to slip past customers who are too uncourteous to pull over as they stop dead in the middle of the aisle to chat on their phones.

The store is also purposely organized in such a way as you pretty much have to walk through every square inch of the store to get even the most basic of grocery necessities.  What's probably the most infuriating thing about Hannafords though is their ridiculous and inconvenient holdups at the checkouts because of alcohol and tobacco sales.  A manager must approve every sale no matter how old the customer obviously is. And even if a manager sees a dozen other customers who are obviously of legal age, they will walk away after approving the first sale and hold up the line again as the next 50 year old in line must be approved totally separately for his bottle of table wine.  I also don't understand why the manager can't ask every other customer in a given line if they need tobacco products before walking away to make everyone else wait once again for him or her to come back and to get the next pack of cigarettes for the next customer in line.

I told the shoe-fit specialist all my various foot, knee, & running issues to give her a jumping-off point as to what my needs might be in a shoe. Then she carefully measured my foot--and not just with a Brannock device: She observed it from a variety of angles, and even watched me walk.

Based on that information, Alison brought out her first couple of best ideas as to what just the right shoe would be for me. I tried each pair on, and each time she had me hop onto the in-store treadmill for a test run. She filmed my stride at heel level from behind. Then she played the recording of the test run back in slow motion, enabling her to do meticulous gait analysis. Alison spent a good amount of dedicated time with me, fine tuning her shoe selections based on the video of me running in each pair, & then moving on to the next pair until, together, we got it just right! It's no coincidence that the correct shoe from her standpoint of expertise on studying my stride was also the one that felt the best to wear. I exclaimed during the test run in that particular shoe, ""It doesn't even feel like I'm wearing anything on my feet!"" Mission accomplished.

It just so happened that the shoe that felt & ran the best for me happened to be last year's model, which was discounted at 20% off. So it's not a high-pressure or upselling vibe there. Skirack simply fits you in the best shoe FOR YOU, whichever product that may be.

Skirack also has an insane exchange policy--at least for the brand I purchased--whereby, if AFTER FULLY USING THE SHOES, outside, running in them, etc, you're not satisfied, you may bring them back & have the money you paid for them put toward a different pair!? (Try pulling that on Zappos.) When you take all this into consideration, it really is not worth buying running shoes online, only to have them arrive in the mail & not be quite right. Put yourself in Skirack's capable hands just once, like I did, and I suspect you'll never buy running shoes anywhere else.",5,"Color me impressed by how good Skirack is at fitting running shoes!

Great selection of AMAZING beers, good food, excellent service, friendly staff who obviously enjoy being there. The only criticism I have; I was in there one time having a delightful time catching up with friends I had not seen in years. Then some guys gets up there on the little stage and plugs in a guitar and amplifier and starts playing and singing so LOUD that I could not hear my friends talking or myself thinking. Granted that part is more about the musician than the SC but they should prevent amplified loud/music there as it is a relatively small place. I know that some people can't stand to be without loud music because they can't stand the sound of their own thoughts. These people should embrace the headphone technology and leave the rest of us to enjoy conversation in great places like the Stone Corral.

So if NP is buying lesser quantity of brand x than City market or other natural foods store, that usually means NP purchases x product at a higher amount than City market and needs to mark it up higher in order to make the same profit.  And by you continuing to support NP irregardless of the slightly higher prices, eventually with more consistent customer support NP will be able to buy more of x product from the company or distributor but at a greater discount that will then extend a lower price to the customer .
